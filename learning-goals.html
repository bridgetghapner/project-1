		<h1>Things I want to learn</h1>
		<p>I'm working on my Product Design and Strategy craft. In the next 2 years I'd like to become a Product Design Manager. Before focusing on managing, I want to build more craft skills. I think that will make me a better manager.</p>
		<h2>Things I'm totally stoked to learn</h2>
		<p>List ordered by enthusiasim</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Front-end web development. I'm not sure if I want to write production code, but I'd like to understand HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React. I'd like to be able to prototype in the browser should the situation call for it.</li>
			<li>Web accessibility. As long as I'm learning front-end, why wouldn't I learn how to make the sites I'm learning to build accessible at the same time?</li>
			<li>Public speaking. As a classic introvery this terrifies me on many levels, however I love going to conferences and hearing from folks about their work. I want to contribute to that and also get the hell over my fears, you know?</li>
